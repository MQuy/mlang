### mC

mC is a toy C compiler that aims to C99-compliant, is written in C++, and use LLVM as backend.

### mHaskell

mHaskell is the mini version of Haskell, it is a functional programming language with the following features:

- Currying
- Lazy evaluation
- Higher order functions
- Lambda lifting
- Pattern matching
- Type inference

### mTS

Similar to mHaskell, mts is the mini version of Typescript(actually, its syntax is mixed between Typescript and Scala). It is, of course, a typed interpreted language that supports basic oop features like class, inheritance, function & lambda, for & while loop ...
