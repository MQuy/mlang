## MLang

MLang is the collection of my own toy programming languages.

### MHaskell

As the name said, mhaskell is the mini version of haskell, therefore, it is an functional programming language with features below:

- Currying
- Lazy evaluation
- Higher order functions
- Lambda lifting
- Pattern matching
- Type inference

### MTS

Similar to mhaskell, mts is the mini version of typescript(actually, its syntax is mixed between typescript and scala). It is, of course, an typed interpreted language which supports basic oop features like class, inheritance, function & lambda, for & while loop ...
